              For this microinteractions class, I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript
              to recreate and make improvements to microinteractions. The
              component I decided to follow were the product cards on Behance.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through an iterative three-phase process (Alpha, Beta, and Final),
              I determined all the triggers, rules, feedback, loops and mode of
              each, and then built the microinteractions according to my
              descriptions.

              From the end of September until the first week of December, I have
              been the solo UX/UI designer and front-end and back-end developer
              of this course-long microinteractions project.

              All changes and additions I made to the microinteractions I
              created for the product card had to be improvements and useful to
              the component. To ensure this, while I was creating the
              descriptions I thought about the functionality the
              microinteraction would serve and in what ways would that improve a
              users experience if at all.

          <h2>Process and Insights:</h2>
          <p class="intro-text">
            This project was split into 3 phases: Alpha, Beta, and Final. In
            order to ensure quality work and follow the timeline in an orderly
            fashion, the Alpha was designed to help me lay the groundwork and
            figure out a starting point to creating microinteractions.
          </p>

          <!-- Alpha Phase -->
          <div class="step">
            <ol start="1">
              <li>Alpha</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="step-content">
              I started by visiting a couple websites trying to gain an
              understanding of different components and their microinteractions.
              From there, I tried to think of potential improvements
            </p>

              <img src="wireframe.jpg" alt="wireframe image" />
            </div>
            <p class="step-content">
              After that, I played around with the colors to decide how I wanted
              the first impression to be. I ultimately decided on a blue theme
              based on my preferences. I wanted to try something new as I tend
              to lean towards a pinker color palette and was hoping to give
              myself a challenge. In addition, the fonts I had chosen were
              further a welcoming feeling with the bubble letters inviting
              whimsy and cute charm.
            </p>
            <div class="process alpha-image">
              <img src="alpha.png" alt="alpha image" />
            </div>
            <p class="step-content">
              Aside from the aesthetics, I also focused on laying the
              foundational technical work. This includes data-mining and
              cleaning. After receiving the folder of files I had to come
              through, I was able to organize it into a table separating
              important valuables with one another which will be more important
              later in Beta. Despite not needing the database to be linked at
              this time, it was vital for me to start ASAP so that when Beta is
              assigned, I can get started immediately.
            </p>
          </div>

          <!-- Beta Phase -->
          <div class="step">
            <ol start="2">
              <li>Beta</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="step-content">
              After Alpha, I ran the colors I originally used through a color
              contrast checker and realized that the blues I had chosen could be
              difficult to read. Because my main goal was to make gathering
              these recipes more accessible, I ended up changing into a higher
              contrast color palette I was more familiar with: pink and magenta
              (put in hex codes)
            </p>
            <div class="process beta-image">
              <img src="beta.png" alt="beta image" />
            </div>
            <p class="step-content">
              After determining the color palette, the base I laid in Alpha
              allowed me to build my PHP and run it through rounds of trial and
              error. The pinks I chose seemed to be more friendly to the eye as
              well as more interesting to look at. I finally got to lay out all
              of the data I had collected and successfully inputted into a
              table.
            </p>
            <p class="step-content">
              At this point, the database of the recipes I was collecting
              earlier has now been implemented to the Beta project so I know how
              each of the recipes will look like on the design I have made, this
              also allowed me to ensure the site's responsiveness and debug
              anything that may have been lost when connecting my data.

            </ol>
            <p class="step-content">
              Based on the critiques from the last projects, I knew that I had
              to design at a bit of a higher level, include more images, and
              ensure all of my fonts were loading. At this point, my design is
              set in stone, it was a matter of making sure that the PHP code was
              clean.
            </p>
            <div class="process final-image">
              <img src="final.png" alt="final image" />
            </div>
            <p class="step-content">
              Troubleshooting why some images loaded in while some did not,
              investigating why fonts were not always loading, and also making
              sure I kept my code consistent is where I had lacked. To do this,
              I started implementing a higher level of microinteractions into
              the project. I have added hover states where I can to push the
              narrative I want to portray of something fun and whimsical. In
              addition, I went back to make sure all the images were loading by
              combing through typos. Lastly, ensuring that the font loads is a
              rookie mistake, but going through each line of your CSS and making
              sure it is as optimized as possible takes a lot of time but I
              managed to get it done.

            You may not be able to tell by this screen but behind this has gone
            through many internal conflicts of design hierarchy, spending lots
            of efforts to make sure my database connection was clean, and rounds
            of critiques. Because of all of that, I was able to make "Recipes"
            what it is at its current stage. A recipe website that is easily
            navigable and organized geared for people who want to have more fun.

            Defining features that would determine whether or not I was
            successful would be the search bar, a wide range of filters to sift
            through, and easily readable text. For this to be as efficient and
            as fun as I wanted it to be I tackled these core things.

              Coming from the stack of pdfs we first received, the product I
              went on to design was to give a place where all of those recipes
              could live at once. To prevent fatigue from the tiring search it
              would've been to read through all those recipes, efficient design
              allows users to search for ingredients they want to use with ease.
              This is solved with my implementation of both the search and
              filter keys.

              Cooking can be intimidating, especially when you might be given a
              large stack of recipes you've never seen before. To ease users in,
              I designed a landing screen to invoke fun and add some character
              which is not common in most other recipe websites (based on
              personal competitor analysis).Using bright and bold/bubbly
              aesthetics brings a warmth to the brand and invites more people to
              come!

            Because this project is a reflection of a hypothetical recipe site,
            its success can be hard to determine. Despite it all, the overall
            design is successful in achieving its goal to be efficient and fun.
            If given more time, I would have liked to include more
            microinteractions to make the website definitely pop. I would also
            try to steer away from my signature color to really push myself to
            design for a wider palette.

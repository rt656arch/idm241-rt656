              For this microinteractions class, I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript
              to recreate and make improvements to microinteractions.
              The components I decided to improve were the product cards on Behance.
Behance is an online platform where creatives get to showcase their work, and I was interested in redesigning it because I was recently introduced to it and thought the platform was cool. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Through an iterative three-phase process (Alpha, Beta, and Final),
              I determined all the triggers, rules, feedback, loops and mode of each phase of the redesigned component, and then built the microinteractions according to my descriptions.

              From the end of September until the first week of December, I have
              been the solo UX/UI designer and front-end developer
              of this course-long microinteractions project.

              All changes and additions I made to the microinteractions I
              created for the product card had to be improvements and useful to
              the component. To ensure this, while I was creating the
              descriptions I thought about the functionality the
              microinteraction would serve and in what ways would that improve a
              users experience if at all.

          <h2>Process and Insights:</h2>
          <p class="intro-text">
            This project was split into 3 phases: Alpha, Beta, and Final. In
            order to ensure quality work and follow the timeline in an orderly
            fashion, the Alpha was designed to help me lay the groundwork and
            figure out a starting point to creating microinteractions.
          </p>

          <!-- Alpha Phase -->
          <div class="step">
            <ol start="1">
              <li>Alpha</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="step-content">
              I started by visiting a couple websites trying to gain an
              understanding of different components and their microinteractions.
              From there, I tried to think of potential improvements.
            </p>

            <p class="step-content">
            Despite being a design platform, Behance has little to no animations for their micro-interactions at all. Their product cards have simple functions to encourage users to login/sign up. I started by building out how Behance has designed the cards exactly. This helps me understand the basics and lays the structuring for how I will begin to improve from there. 
            </p>
            <div class="process alpha-image">
              <img src="alpha-build.png" alt="alpha build">
            </div>
            <p class="step-content">
             After determining what makes Behance’s product card unique, I began to ideate improvements based on the current design and the feasibility of the project.
            </p>
          </div>

          <!-- Beta Phase -->
        <div class="step">
            <ol start="2">
              <li>Beta</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="step-content">
              The first iteration of improvements includes a hover animation on the Behance logo that is revealed when a user is already on the card. I wanted to make the sudden appearance of the behance tag to instead, slide down smoothly.   </p>

            <p class="step-content">
              In addition to the hover animation on the behance tag, I added a hover animation onto the “Saved” button. It changes opacity once the mouse enters the button’s space and the opacity change to 100% allows the user to know they can click on it to save. I noticed that on product cards with darker images, the user can't really tell if they're hovered over it or not, so I made the initial opacity a lighter gray 
                to contrast better with both light and dark images.

            <ol start="3">
              <li>Finals</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="step-content">
            In this final stage I decided to include a like feature and gave room for the post information which would also be interactable. The like button is represented by an icon, the thumbs up, and will have its own animation once selected. Not only does it jump and rotate slightly, the gray icon slowly becomes blue. As for the post information, it is indicated that a user can interact with it as an underline appears underneath the text.
            </p>
            <div class="process final-image">
              <img src="final-bottom.png" alt="like feature">
            </div>
            <p class="step-content">
             Another microinteraction that I implemented is the hover state of the poster specifically. When hovered on, the profile of the poster would appear with some details regarding their profile stats like followers and views. I thought this would be important to include in the case a user wanted quick access to this profiles’s credibility.

          <p class="step-content">
            Including more feedback for a curious user. The original offers similar features but the actions that are implied to continue interacting with the card is not clear nor defined. I improved this by giving the user smooth feedback through animated hover states.

            I think that I was able to follow Behance’s current branding very well. By implementing small details to an already published work can be messy due to the scope of branding however I was able to improve without straying away from the sleek and modern layout Behance is known for. If given more time I would build out the profile pop up and try to iterate on improvements with the microinteractions on that too, and also implementing a scrolling animation whenever a number increases or decreases when a user likes the product.
